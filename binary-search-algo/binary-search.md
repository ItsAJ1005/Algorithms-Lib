# Binary Search üîç

In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval
search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm
that finds the position of a target value within a sorted
array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle
element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which
the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues
on the remaining half until it is successful. If the search
ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not
in the array.

## Drawbacks of Binary Search:

- The array should be sorted.

- Binary search requires that the data structure being searched be stored in contiguous memory locations. 

- Binary search requires that the elements of the array be comparable, meaning that they must be able to be ordered.

## Applications of Binary Search:

- Binary search can be used as a building block for more complex algorithms used in machine learning, such as algorithms for training neural networks or finding the optimal hyperparameters for a model.

- It can be used for searching in computer graphics such as algorithms for ray tracing or texture mapping.

- It can be used for searching a database.

## Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(log(n))` - since we split search area by two for every
next iteration.

**Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
